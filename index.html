                    <p><b>Web development</b> is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality
                        of
                        websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually
                        reserved
                        for the actual
                        construction and programming of websites and apps.Think of all the websites you have used over
                        the
                        years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in
                        ways
                        that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using
                        a
                        variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the
                        platforms they are working on.</p>
